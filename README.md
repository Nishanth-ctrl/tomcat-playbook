# tomcat-playbook
Example playbook for installing Tomcat and a Jenkins pipeline to test and deploy it to Ansible Tower or AWX.

# How
* The Jenkins pipeline is the file called Jenkinsfile. For information about installing Jenkins, visit: https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/ for information about how to setup pipelines from a Jenkinsfile, visit: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/ 

* To be able to run the pipeline, you need to first install tower-cli and ansible-lint on your Jenkins server/slave. To do that run the following on your Jenkins server/slave:
```
# yum install python2-pip
# pip2 install ansible-tower-cli
# pip2 install ansible-lint
```
* Next you configure the tower-cli to automatically login. For information on how to configure tower-cli, visit: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/towerapi/tower_cli.html
